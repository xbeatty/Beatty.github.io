My experience ranges from working with the building blocks of life such as DNA, RNA, and protein to running a clinical trial with patients and everything in between.  Along with knowledge of laboratory tools and equipment, I have worked extensively with many computer programs such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Graphpad, as well as other data analysis software. I have also enhanced my skills in many different types of research techniques and protocols such as different aspects of molecular biology and tissue culture. My work experience has taught me how to communicate effectively in both the written and verbal language, where I am comfortable and confident giving presentations in front of large groups of people. Moreover, working in a lab I have learned to be very organized, keeping detailed notes and data, which is continually updated and shared throughout the lab.

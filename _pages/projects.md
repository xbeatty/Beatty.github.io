### Colorado State University

Currently, enrolled in the Cell and Molecular Biology PhD program at CSU in Dawn Duval's lab. Studying, cancer biology in canines. 

### IMMUNITYBIO INC.

Performed experiments to generate new viral vectors into cells/yeast to create different types of viruses. After which, expanded the virus to make viral seed stocks (VSS) to be used in large scale manufacturing (GMP). Simultaneously, I characterized the different viruses by transducing cells/yeast to perform multiplicity of infection (MOI) studies, then performed titer on the samples via either qPCR or protein detection. Along with these tasks, I was instrumental in qualifying and transferring the analytical methods for the companyâ€™s new mRNA platform to the QC department by creating SOPs for guidance. 

### Revvity

Researched and developed, or improved upon, innovative new technologies for CRISPR Cas9 systems. Lost position due to slow sales resulting from COVID-19 shutdowns.

### VIRIDIAN THERAPEUTICS, INC.

Research and development of an oncology drug that is currently in phase 2 clinical trials. While the drug was initially in the clinic, I assisted in creating data for patent purposes and helped present findings in several scientific journals, of which are referenced below. I also aided in the development of other drugs to treat fibrosis and heart disease. As a member of the Translational Biology group, I was tasked with examining our drug against, or in conjunction with, the standard of care. I performed these experiments, most of which involving small molecule compounds, and used statistical analysis to examine drug synergism and dose effectiveness.

### UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO HEALTH AND SCIENCE CENTER

Created a transgenic mouse with a Cre-Lox insert which is activated by administration of tamoxifen to examine the effects of Multiple Sclerosis at different stages of development. Carried out clinical trials and managed patient records for a Multiple Sclerosis clinic.

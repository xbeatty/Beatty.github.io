### Laboratory Skills

- Molecular Techniques
  - Western blot to detect specific proteins in different cell types and/or tissues. 
  - Northern blot to detect specific RNA sequences in cell types and/or tissues, and also to examine RNA integrity. 
  - Design oligonucleotides (e.g. primer/probe) for PCR and DNA sequencing, as well as using different computer programs to analyze the results. 
  - qPCR and RT-qPCR to examine gene or microRNA expression. 
  - Run toxicity assay to assess drug effects on in vivo models. 
  - Develop and run different types of assays and ELISA, including colorimetric, florescence, luminescence, etc. 
  - Developed a protocol for assessing proliferation and apoptosis over time in different cell lines, with time points going out to 2 weeks post treatment. 
  - Use of Flow to examine different cell populations and their phenotypic changes over time with treatment.


### Programs and Instruments

- Microscopy: Light, Florescent, Dissecting Microscopes, Confocal, etc.
- Use of multiple laboratory equipment: nanodrop, plate readers, Viia7, Cytoflex, BioRad chemidoc, thermocycler, liquid handlers, Nexcelom, Nova, Countess, etc.
- Programs: MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, GraphPad, FlowJo, ImageJ, electronic notebooks, Google Docs, MatLab, etc.
